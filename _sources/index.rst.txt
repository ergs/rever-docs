Rever: Releaser of Versions!
============================
Rever is a xonsh-powered, cross-platform software release tool.  The
goal of rever is to provide sofware projects a standard mechanism for dealing with
code released. Rever aims to make the process of releasing a new version of a code base
as easy as running a single command. Rever...

* has a number of stock tools and utilities that you can mix and match to meet your projects needs,
* is easily extensible, allowing your project to execute custom release activities, and
* allows you to undo release activities, in the event of a mistake!


==================
Initializing Rever
==================
There are a couple steps you should take to get the most out of rever.

1. Install rever. Rever is on conda-forge so install via
   ``conda install rever -c conda-forge``, via pypi with ``pip install re-ver``,
   or from source.

2. Setup a ``rever.xsh`` file in the root directory of your source repository.
   Here is a simplified example from ``rever`` itself,

    .. code-block:: xonsh

          $PROJECT = 'rever'
          $ACTIVITIES = [
                        'version_bump',  # Changes the version number in various source files (setup.py, __init__.py, etc)
                        'changelog',  # Uses files in the news folder to create a changelog for release
                        'tag',  # Creates a tag for the new version number
                        'push_tag',  # Pushes the tag up to the $TAG_REMOTE
                        'pypi',  # Sends the package to pypi
                        'conda_forge',  # Creates a PR into your package's feedstock
                        'ghrelease'  # Creates a Github release entry for the new tag
                         ]
          $VERSION_BUMP_PATTERNS = [  # These note where/how to find the version numbers
                                   ('rever/__init__.py', '__version__\s*=.*', "__version__ = '$VERSION'"),
                                   ('setup.py', 'version\s*=.*,', "version='$VERSION',")
                                   ]
          $CHANGELOG_FILENAME = 'CHANGELOG.rst'  # Filename for the changelog
          $CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE = 'TEMPLATE.rst'  # Filename for the news template
          $TAG_REMOTE = 'git@github.com:regro/rever.git'  # Repo to push tags to

          $GITHUB_ORG = 'regro'  # Github org for Github releases and conda-forge
          $GITHUB_REPO = 'rever'  # Github repo for Github releases  and conda-forge

3. After setting up the ``rever.xsh`` file run ``rever setup`` in the root
   directory of your source repository. This will setup files and other things
   needed for rever to operate.

4. When you are ready to release run ``rever <new_version_number>`` and rever
   will take care of the rest.
